Project Setup - pnpm + Vite

// This readme file provides instructions on setting up a project using the pnpm package manager and Vite build tool. By following these steps, you will have a basic project structure ready for development.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- pnpm (version 6 or above)

Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   git clone <"https://github.com/Tranton2808/portfolio-2.git">

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:
   cd portfolio-2

3. Install project dependencies using pnpm:
   pnpm install

// This command will read the pnpm-lock.yaml file and install all required packages specified in it.

4. Start the development server:
   pnpm run dev

<!-- This will start the development server using Vite. The default configuration will serve the project on http://localhost:8080. -->

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8080. You should see your project up and running!
